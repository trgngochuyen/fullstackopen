This project was created using React.

## What it does

It generates a random anecdote every time the 'next anecdote' button is hit. It allows users to 'vote' for the currently displayed anecdote. It also informs how many votes an anecdote has, and which anecdote from the pool has the biggest number of votes.

## What I learned

 - Creating a zero-filled array of an arbitrary length
 - Passing arrays into states
